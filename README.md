Simulation example

Simulation of a Bank Teller

As an example of the concept of simulation, the processing of customers by a teller at a bank will be considered. Customers arrive at the bank, wait for service by the teller if the teller is busy, are served, and then depart the system. Customers arriving to the system when the teller is busy wait in a single queue in front of the teller. For simplicity, assume that the time of arrival of a customer and the service time by the teller for each customer are known and are shown below. Our objective is to manually simulate the above system to determine the percent of time the teller is idle and the average time a customer spends at the bank.
